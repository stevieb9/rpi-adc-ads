Revision history for Perl extension RPi::ADC::ADS

0.08 UNREL
        - combined all the config register subs into a BEGIN block, we now auto
          generate them all and put them into the symbol table. This reduces a
          lot of code copy/paste

0.07    2017-01-10
        - POD fixes
        - added _bit_set(), and consolodated a lot of repetitive config
          register bit switching
        - removed _register_default(). We now set this in the new() call to
          0x80 (MSB) and 0x00 (LSB)

0.06    2017-01-10
        - all configuration register options are now available (less bits 4 and
          2)
        - complete overhaul on setting the config register
        - we now unset and set the config register using bitwise operators
          instead of math hackery
        - nearly everything has tests
        - added extensive documentation for the software, along with all the
          specifications of the configuration register settings
